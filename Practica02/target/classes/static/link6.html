                    <p>The experiment in corporate disruption that was the partnership between Kanye West and Gap is officially over.</br>

Ye, as Mr. West is now known, formally notified Gap via a letter on Thursday that he was terminating their agreement involving the Yeezy Gap apparel line,</br> citing breach of contract. Instead, Ye is moving ahead with plans to open his own stores.

The partnership, announced with a drumroll of publicity in June 2020, had the possibility of lasting 10 years and, Gap hoped, generating more than $1 billion in </br>annual sales. Yeezy Gap would encompass men’s, women’s and children’s wear and benefit both sides, turning around the fortunes of the Gap by giving it the veneer of cool and giving Ye access to the mass market.

Gap acknowledged that the agreement was ending in a message to employees.

“While we share a vision of bringing high-quality, trend-forward, utilitarian design to all people through </br>unique omni experiences with Yeezy Gap, how we work together to deliver this vision is not aligned,” the Gap brand president, Mark Breitbard, wrote. “And we are deciding to wind down the partnership.”
