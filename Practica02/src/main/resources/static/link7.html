        <P>Kanye West has trolled Adidas by moving his Yeezy office next door to the German sportswear giant's flagship store in Los Angeles as they are<br/> currently selling the remaining stock of his sneaker label.

New photos show that the 45-year-old artist<br/> - who is no stranger to controversy - has moved his company office next to Adidas's<br/> store on the highly-popular Melrose Ave which sold his once-coveted sneaker.

This comes as the sneaker giant has put the remaining stock of his Yeezy<br/> shoes on Wednesday  months after cutting ties with the Can't Tell Me Nothin' hitmaker.<br/> 
he first batch of Adidas’s remaining Yeezys went on sale on Wednesday. The sneakers appear to be available through Adidas’s app 'Confirmed', according to the retailer’s website.

Part of the profits will be donated to organizations including the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, Adidas said.<br/>

Wednesday’s release marks the first time that Adidas has sold Yeezys since the partnership termination in October. The Yeezy products up for sale will include <br/>already-existing designs as well as those that were initiated in 2022 and set to be released in 2023, Adidas previously noted.

'We believe (selling and donating these Yeezys) is the best solution as it respects the created designs and produced shoes, it works for our people,<br/> resolves an inventory problem, and will have a positive impact in our communities,' Mr Gulden said in a statement on May 19.
